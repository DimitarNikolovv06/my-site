Built an app that allows users to create, read, update and
delete notes and users. Users cannot edit, delete or add
notes to another user unless they have admin privileges but
they can read them. You do have to be logged in however to
have access to any of the mentioned above actions.React
router is used for navigation between components.The
logged user is stored in the localStorage and is removed
from there once the user logs out. I made this project with
React and Bootstrap for the front- end and Json-Server for
my back-end.
